# Minesweeper C++ Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Minesweeper project, developed as part of the Introduction to Programming Practicum course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski". This classic game challenges players to strategically uncover cells in a matrix while avoiding hidden mines.

## Objective

The primary objective of Minesweeper is to reveal all cells in the matrix that are not marked as mines. Players must carefully uncover cells, and if they accidentally reveal a mine, the game is lost. The challenge lies in deducing the locations of the mines based on the numbers displayed in adjacent cells, which indicate the number of mines in proximity.

## Features

* Grid Representation: The game is played on a matrix grid.

* Cell Interaction: Players can uncover cells to reveal numbers or mines, as well as mark or unmark potential mines.

* Mines: Hidden mines pose a threat, and revealing one ends the game.

* Number Indicators: Numbers indicate the count of mines in adjacent cells.

* Winning: Successfully uncovering all non-mine cells leads to victory.
